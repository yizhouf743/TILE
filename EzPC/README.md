The test code for Conv-Relu(the basic unit on vgg and resnet) with TILE on SCI/tests/test_field_TILE.cpp

The test code for network can be found in SCI/networks

For example:

For vgg16_cifar10 with TILE, we can found it on SCI/networks/main_vgg16_TILE.cpp

For its baseline on SCI/networks/main_vgg16_baseline.cpp
