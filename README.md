# TILE
This is the project for the work: "TILE: Input Structure Optimization for Neural Networks to Accelerate Secure Inference".
The codes are still under developments, and should not be used in any security sensitive product.

# Notes:
We are using model pruning technologies from the paper: "MOSAIC: A Prune-and-Assemble Approach for Efficient Model Pruning in Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning". 
We are not showing the code related to this paper, as it is not publicly available. We will update this section once their code becomes publicly accessible.

We will cleanup the code in this repo.
