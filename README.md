# TILE
This is the project for the work: "TILE: An  Input Structuring and Leveling System to Speed up Secure Inference".
The codes are still under developments, and should not be used in any security sensitive product.

# Notes:
We are using model pruning technologies from the paper: "MOSAIC: A Prune-and-Assemble Approach for Efficient Model Pruning in Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning". 
We are not showing the code related to this paper, as it is not publicly available. We will update this section once their code becomes publicly accessible.

# Requirements:
openssl 

c++ compiler 

cmake >= 3.13

git

make

OpenMP
