# TILE
This is the project for the work: "TILE: Input Structure Optimization for Neural Networks to Accelerate Secure Inference".
The codes are still under developments, and should not be used in any security sensitive product.

# Content:
EzPC: A framework that help to covert pytorch code to HE-friendly cpp code.
pytorch: The implmentaion for TILE on VGG16 and Resnet50 on Cifar10 and Tiny-Imagenet, including TILE searching, fine-tuning, running inference and so on.

# Notes:
We are using model pruning technologies from the paper: "MOSAIC: A Prune-and-Assemble Approach for Efficient Model Pruning in Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning". 
We are not showing the code related to this paper, as it is not publicly available. We will update this section once their code becomes publicly accessible.

The implementation to reproduce the results in the paper can be found here: EzPC/SCI/build.

We will optimize and cleanup the code in this repo.

The code current updated on: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TILE-88D2
